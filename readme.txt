Curate YouTube content like never before.

== Description ==

A new powerful way to show YouTube content on your WordPress sites.  
We want our visitors to stay on the website - we don't want to redirect them elsewhere.

Curator Studio achieves this by being extremely flexible in pulling various types of YouTube sources.  
**Free version** can show videos from any YouTube channel or playlist.  

**Pro version** can combine videos / playlists from multiple channels, playlists, search terms, categories, regions etc.
