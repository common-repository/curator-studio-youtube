This is a very data driven app.
Almost all of the HTML elements and styles are generated from data - either saved as hard-coded JS objects or served from the database.

If you're looking for customization, the best way is to check PHP code.
You can use Curator Studio's normalized data in you own UIs.
Data structures & query parameters are same across all of our social media feed plugins.

We hope to make an easy Data API interface & documentation in the near future.
